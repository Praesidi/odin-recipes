      <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Gather all the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Soak about 10 to 12 (5-inch) bamboo skewers in water for 30 minutes.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>To Make the Yakitori Sauce (Tare)</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>In a small saucepan, add the mirin, soy sauce, sake, water, brown sugar, and the green part of one scallion. Bring it to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until reduced to one-third of the original volume. It will take about 30 minutes. Let it cool to room temperature before using. The sauce will thicken with a glossy shine as it cools. <strong>Note:</strong> You can make the sauce ahead of time. Put only the sauce (without the green onion) in a mason jar. Store in the refrigerator for up to 2-3 months.</li>
        <li>Reserve one-third of the sauce in a small bowl for final coating, just before serving. Use this reserved sauce with a clean brush only after the chicken is cooked to prevent cross contamination.</li>
        <li>Cut the white and light green parts of the remaining scallions into 1-inch (2.5 cm) pieces.</li>
        <li>Cut the chicken into 1-inch (2.5 cm) cubes.</li>
        <li>On a flat work surface, fold each slice of chicken in half, insert a bamboo skewer into the chicken at a 45-degree angle, and press down on the skewer to pierce the meat through the center.</li>
        <li>Next, add a piece of scallion perpendicular to the skewer. Continue to alternate chicken slices with pieces of scallion, ending with a piece of chicken. Each 5-inch skewer will hold about 4 chicken slices and 3 scallion pieces.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>To Grill/Broil the Yakitori</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Grease the grate of the broiler/wire rack (or oven-safe cooling rack) to keep the chicken from sticking to the grate. Place the skewers on top.</li>
        <li>Set the broiler to High and wait until the heating elements are hot. Then, place the skewers under the broiler. Broil for 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>After 6 minutes, brush the meat on both sides with the Yakitori Sauce. Continue to broil for 3-4 minutes to caramelize the sauce.</li>
        <li>To serve remove the skewers to a serving plate. With a clean brush, baste the top of the chicken skewers with the reserved sauce.</li>
      </ol>

    <div class="notes">
      <h3>NOTES</h3>
      <p>If you accidentally cross contaminate (dip the same brush you used on the uncooked chicken during cooking), you will have to boil the sauce again. Serve and enjoy!</p>
